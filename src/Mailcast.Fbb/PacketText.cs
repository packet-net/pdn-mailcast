/// Encoding helpers for human-readable header text carried over the packet

/// <c>Subject:</c> (spec §3.9). The body of a message is handled elsewhere
/// (stored raw, decoded UTF-8-or-Latin-1 at display); these helpers cover the
/// SUBJECT/title fields, which are stored as decoded strings and so must be
/// decoded correctly at ingest and round-trip faithfully at egress.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <para><b>Ingest (<see cref="DecodeHeader"/>):</b> decode as UTF-8 when the
/// bytes are valid UTF-8 (strict decoder), otherwise fall back to Latin-1.
/// Modern gateways/Winlink emit UTF-8 subjects; legacy FBB BBSes emit Latin-1.
/// A strict UTF-8 attempt distinguishes the two losslessly: any byte run that
/// is not well-formed UTF-8 (e.g. a lone 0xA3 '£') falls through to Latin-1,
/// where every single byte maps to the matching U+0000..U+00FF code point.</para>
///
/// <para><b>Egress (<see cref="EncodeHeader"/>):</b> always encode as UTF-8.
/// This is correct and interop-safe:</para>
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item>UTF-8 of an ASCII string == ASCII bytes == Latin-1 bytes, so ASCII
/// subjects are byte-identical on the wire - no interop change.</item>
/// <item>A UTF-8 subject decoded then UTF-8-encoded reproduces the SAME bytes
/// (byte-faithful round-trip), so a received UTF-8 subject is forwarded
/// unchanged.</item>
/// <item>Only a genuine Latin-1 high-byte subject (e.g. 0xA3 '£', invalid
/// UTF-8 → decoded as Latin-1 → U+00A3) re-encodes to 2 UTF-8 bytes
/// (0xC2 0xA3) - a deliberate, rare "upgrade". This fixes display without
/// degrading the forward; Latin-1 egress would instead turn a received UTF-8
/// subject into '?' downstream, which is why we do NOT encode as Latin-1.</item>
